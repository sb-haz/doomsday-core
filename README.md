- **Player Effects**: Potion effects, movement changes, health impact based on disaster type
- **Cleanup Systems**: Automatic restoration when disasters end (floods recede, etc.)

### Centralized Nation Player Tracking
- **In-Memory Cache**: Real-time tracking of which online players are in which nations
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Automatically maintains accuracy through player join/quit/nation change events
- **Performance Optimized**: Eliminates repeated scanning of all online players
- **Thread-Safe**: Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` for multi-threaded server environments
- **Instant Lookups**: O(1) access to online player counts and nation memberships

#### Tracking System Usage

The plugin automatically maintains an in-memory cache of online players by nation. This system:

**Initialization:**
- Builds cache on plugin startup by scanning all currently online players
- Creates empty tracking sets for all configured nations

**Automatic Updates:**
- **Player Join**: Adds player to their nation's online set (if they have one)
- **Player Quit**: Removes player from all tracking
- **Nation Changes**: Updates tracking when players join/leave nations
- **Server Restart**: Rebuilds cache from current online players

**API Methods for Developers:**
```java
// Get all online players in a specific nation
Set<UUID> playersInAmerica = nationPlayerManager.getOnlinePlayersInNation("america");

// Get online player count for a nation
int onlineCount = nationPlayerManager.getOnlinePlayerCountInNation("africa");

// Get counts for all nations (used by scoreboard)
Map<String, Integer> allCounts = nationPlayerManager.getOnlinePlayerCountsByNation();

// Quick nation lookup for online players
String playerNation = nationPlayerManager.getOnlinePlayerNation(playerId);
```

**Current Usage in Plugin:**
- **Scoreboard**: Displays real-time online/total citizen counts (e.g., "America: 5, Europe: 3")
- **Messaging System**: Sends missiles/disasters/anti-air alerts only to online nation members
- **Nation GUIs**: Shows "Online/Total" format (e.g., "Citizens: 5/12")
- **Broadcasting**: Efficiently targets specific nations without scanning all players

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Before**: Each scoreboard update scanned all online players (expensive)
- **After**: Instant lookup from cached data structure
- **Before**: Each nation message iterated through all players
- **After**: Direct access to target nation's player set

## Installation
